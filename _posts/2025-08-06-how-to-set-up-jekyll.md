This is me trying out jekyll.

Things are still under construction! and I am still learning Jekyll.

Proposal:

- To come up with a digital writing space that is free of an y distraction
- A space to learn grow, express and share my learnings with the world
- To build my brand as a developer
- Should become my portfolio in the longer run. 
- Should be low effort, I should spend 90% of time writing and learning rather than beautification
- Should be free and open source!
